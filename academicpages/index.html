<p><strong>Hello and welcome to my personal academic website!</strong></p>

<p>I am a Computer Science specialist with extensive experience in university teaching, software development, and data analysis. For over a decade, I have contributed to the education of undergraduate and postgraduate professionals in areas such as programming, databases, data science, and business intelligence—combining academic practice with the implementation of real-world technological solutions.</p>

<p>I have led multiple software development projects focused on information systems applied to health, education, data analysis, and sustainability. In my role as a lecturer and researcher, I have also coordinated technology-driven initiatives aimed at solving concrete problems with social impact.</p>

<p>My approach combines the computational resolution of complex problems, the functional design of digital tools, and the integration of artificial intelligence and data visualization into decision-making processes. Convinced of the transformative power of education, technology, and collaborative work, my goal is to continue driving projects that generate value both in academic settings and in professional and institutional environments.</p>
