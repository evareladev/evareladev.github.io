Industry 4.0 and 5.0 models aim to leverage the advantages enabled by technology and human intellect to promote industrial and commercial development, while simultaneously addressing current challenges. However, the transition toward Industry 5.0 is not easy and requires a transformation of the foundational principles of industry. This article explores the contribution of Blockchain in proposing work models that align with the ideals of Industry 5.0. Through this review of the state of the art concerning Blockchain-based solutions aligned with Industry 5.0 ideals, the aim is to broaden the discussion around the role this technology plays in the transition toward long-term sustainable industrial models.</p>

In recent years, humanity has witnessed significant changes occurring in society, where innovation based on scientific knowledge and the rapid pace of technological development have become fundamental pillars of contemporary society. These elements have successfully integrated and exerted a strong influence at virtually all levels and sectors of society. While the widespread adoption of technology has enabled opportunities for substantial improvements in quality of life, individual well-being, access to basic services, and overall societal development, many complex situations still exist that pose real challenges. These challenges have not been adequately addressed through traditional work models and currently available tools.</p>

    <p class="archive__item-excerpt" itemprop="description"><p>Abstract. Migration (irregular and forced) represents one of the major challenges the international community faces today. Inasmuch as the phenomenon of irregular and forced migration is the marker of the state of socio-economic systems around the world, the response to and the ways of navigating the resulting multi-scalar challenges mirror not only the efficiency of the global regulatory frameworks, but also our civility. Recognizing the potential inherent in sophisticated information and communication technology (ICT), specifically the blockchain technology and smart contracts, this paper focuses on the special case of “welcome centers” that irregular migrants enter in the hope of acquiring international legal protection and thus refugee status. Since the process may be time-consuming and the living conditions undignified, this paper proposes a tool, named here “responsible wallet”, aka rWallet, that bears the promise of navigating some of these challenges. rWallet derives from the recognition that in modern societies ICT should serve the purpose of improving the quality of life of all people..</p>

    <p class="archive__item-excerpt" itemprop="description"><p>Abstract. New Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) are changing the way in which the world works. These technologies provide new tools to face the issues of contemporary society (poverty, migrations, sustainable development challenges, governance, etc.). Among them, blockchain emerge as a disruptive technology able to make things in a completely different and innovative way. They can provide solutions where before there were none. Recently, these technologies have become subject of intense research and development by industry and academia. In consequence, a large amount of interesting works is published in many areas, proposing solutions, services, frameworks and applications based on these technologies. The research focusing on the previous challenges are especially interesting in current society. However, the proposals arrive at higher speed than society can assimilate them, and sometimes they are not properly exploited. Thus, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of the blockchain technology to identify what are its key attributes that enable to successfully address the social challenges. The review has been conducted from three point of views: service-delivery, resource-management and city-administration, and has been focused on the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations, in order to cover the full agenda of current social issues. The contributions of this work are an exhaustive compilation of the existing research on blockchain technology to tackle the social challenges from several angles, and the identification of the key features and the conditioning factors of the practical applicability of the technology.</p>

    <p class="archive__item-excerpt" itemprop="description"><p>Abstract. In El Salvador, since 2009 an initiative based on social solidarity economy has emerged as a measure to face the difficulties of economic development and the lack of access to financial services adapted to the needs of the communities in the area. With this initiative, great progress has been made, such as savings and loan groups, small collective businesses and the organization of cooperatives. However, there are still many opportunities for improvement in areas such as trust, the distribution of responsibilities and the promotion of voluntary cooperation in the different activities carried out within the groups. This paper explores the contribution that Blockchain and its underlying technologies such as smart contracts and tokens can make to overcome these challenges, through the implementation of an incentive strategy called Token Bienestar.</p>

    <p class="archive__item-excerpt" itemprop="description"><p>Abstract. The Smart Society is a model of social organization that, under a participatory approach, explores the opportunities generated by emerging technologies to establish a perspective of social progress that enables citizens to contribute in two main areas: (1) the possibility of participating in the process of development and implementation of public policies and services; (2) citizens are established as the main force to address the phenomena that affect society. The aim is to transfer the potential shown by citizens to influence the social sphere, and thereby improve the mechanisms to address the challenges that limit the process of social development. Promoting this perspective of thinking requires the transformation of traditional foundations, not only on the side of governments and political leaders, business, and other stakeholders, but also on the side of citizens themselves. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the new profile that the citizen must adopt in the context of the Smart Society.</p>

    <p class="archive__item-excerpt" itemprop="description"><p>Abstract. The Smart City urban development model has captured the attention of political representatives and international organizations, nowadays, the development of services and tools based on the Smart City model has become a key issue when talking about urban development strategies, urban policies, and sustainable economic growth. Preparing the city for the imminent digital era is a priority, not only does it require a redesign of the city itself, but it is also necessary to think about a redesign of society in general, this gives way to a new concept: Smart Society, which is based on addressing the challenges caused by urban development but prioritizing the well-being of people. But due to the innovative and adaptable nature of the Smart City and Smart Society development models, there is no standardized agreement on the definition of each term and, above all, we have observed that there are difficulties in identifying the differentiating elements between both concepts, which propose to be able to respond to current and future challenges, promoting economic growth, the use of resources in a sustainable manner and greatly improving the quality of life of people in an inclusive way. This work seeks to explore, through a systematized literature review, the key characteristics that allow the construction of a guideline to differentiate the Smart City concept from the Smart Society concept.</p>

    <p class="archive__item-excerpt" itemprop="description"><p>Abstract. Eradication of poverty and social exclusion has been one of the main goals of the international community for several years now. With the implementation of specific policies, frequently directly aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), governments and international organizations adopted measures to assist vulnerable groups worldwide. As data suggests, while existing problems and challenges are far from being solved, new challenges arise. Against this backdrop, in this work, by focusing on specific issues and challenges, and by showcasing developments in the European Union (EU), we propose a model based on cryptocurrency technologies to suggest how certain of these challenges can be addressed. In this view, the findings of research presented here add to the discussion on how to attain SDG 10, i.e. “Reduce inequalities within and among countries”..</p>

    <p class="archive__item-excerpt" itemprop="description"><p>The research presented in this article proposes the development of an application for calculating the average flow velocity of a river, aimed at flood risk management in vulnerable areas—a problem that has affected El Salvador in recent years. To implement this proposal, a Python program has been developed that uses the YOLO algorithm to identify objects within video frames, as well as a tracking algorithm based on the centroid method, which captures the central point of the identified object and stores a record of recognized objects throughout the video. With this record, it is possible to calculate the average speed of each identified object using established mathematical methods, including the conversion of pixels to meters in the obtained result. All this information can be clearly and accurately displayed through a graphical interface, allowing the end user to visualize the results of the calculations performed on a provided input video.</p>

    <p class="archive__item-excerpt" itemprop="description"><p>Abstract. In countries with high vulnerability, it is necessary to have a tool that allows the simulation - at low cost - of risks due to climatic hazards and allows the analysis of possible interventions of mitigation works to minimize long-term losses. In this study, the ECA-CLIMADA methodology was implemented in an urban river within the metropolitan area of San Salvador. The results obtained are satisfactory and useful to show what will happen in 25 and 30 years before the climate change scenarios that are expected for only one hazard, in this case the rain.</p>
